Let's talk about all the exploit and malwares we have seen up till now

1- > setgid.c :

Just go through https://www.exploit-db.com/exploits/33824/ this link have a image on the right side which which show how we can access files of unprivilage user

2- > apport_local_privi.c

link of the exploit https://www.exploit-db.com/exploits/36746/

This exploit is tested uptill kernel 3.13.0-58-generic i.e ubuntu 14.04 this exploit will give u the root privilage to an unprivilaged user.

to run this exploit just do : $ gcc -static exploitname ; $ ./a.out

3 -> fuse_exploit.sh 

the link of the exploit description https://www.exploit-db.com/exploits/37089/

but to run this exploit just do $ ./fuse_exploit.sh and when a root user login in again and when that user logged out the malicious user will get the root access.

4 ->3.10_kernel_exploit_recvmsg.c ->Linux Kernel 3.4 < 3.13.2 - Arbitrary write with CONFIG_X86_X32 

The description link of the exploit is https://www.exploit-db.com/exploits/31346/

i have tested this kernel 3.8.0 and donot forgot to stop smap at the boottime otherwise this will not work and in order to run it to kernel less than 3.13 just change kernel pointers .


5 -> 3.10_localroot_recvmsg.c -> Linux Kernel 3.4 < 3.13.2 - Local Root (CONFIG_X86_X32=y)

the description of the exploit https://www.exploit-db.com/exploits/31347/

i have tested this kernel 3.8.0 and donot forgot to stop smap at the boottime otherwise this will not work and in order to run it to kernel less than 3.13 just change kernel pointers .

6->15.04_overlay_local_privi.c 

the description of the exploit https://www.exploit-db.com/exploits/37292/

i have tested this exploit uptill 15.04 and this is quite latest one and work onalmost all the kernel available

7->apport_fedora_exploit.c 

the description of the exploit https://www.exploit-db.com/exploits/36747/

this exploit is same as apport_local_privi.c but above one is for ubuntu based and this one is for fedora based uptill fedora 21.

this zip file contain some malwares which will collect all the system usefull information and send it to the C&C server if the vulnerabile elastic search will running on your system

9 -> VFU_4.10_buffer_overflow.py

this is exploit for arbitary code execution using buffer overflow vulnerability in VFU file system in this using return2libc technique in order to bypass dep protection.

10->slowhttptest - Application Layer Dos Attack Simulator 

Just follow this link https://code.google.com/p/slowhttptest/wiki/InstallationAndUsage to install it and use it

11 -> bonesi-master.zip - It is a layer 7/4 DDos Simulator 

This is quite powerfull u can attack to a person using 50k bot-nets at a time 

12 -> samples.rar -Linux/BillGates

This is quite new malware and the link which contain lot of information about this malware is http://www.kernelmode.info/forum/viewtopic.php?f=16&t=3429 and password for above malware is 'infected'

this is the link to track this malware and remove it https://github.com/ValdikSS/billgates-botnet-tracker

13->  b7bcb6f4a721152bedade8eece64c0939bca55abe0a1d8fc677d8e13b09a6825(1).zip

this is like a linux backdoor and password for zip is infected.
