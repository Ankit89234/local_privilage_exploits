First this exploit code which was there in the nginx folder named exp-nginx.rb will work only with the binary of the nginx which is in nginx folder because the the rop gadgets and got address was taken from that binary if u want to run this exploit on any nginx version 1.4.0 then u have to find the offsets of that binary.

for run this exploit 
1 untar the folder 
2 make a directory ubuntu in /home
